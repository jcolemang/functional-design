#+TITLE: The Decorator Pattern
#+AUTHOR: James Coleman Gibson and Sabrina Wicker

In OOP, the decorator pattern is used to attach additional responsibilities
to objects dynamically. Using "decorators" greatly increases the flexibility
of a design, especially when your model calls for lots of modifications to
existing objects or adding new objects to the model. The decorator pattern
adheres quite well to the design principle of "code should be open for
extension, but closed for modification," known as the Open-Closed principle.

Consider a setup that emulates a basic cafe. This cafe has basic drinks like
a house blend, a dark roast, decaf, and espresso. You can also add to your
drink. Let's say the cafe offers milk, soy, mocha, and whip. Your drink can
have one base, but any number of additions. For example, you can have a
decaf drink with milk, mocha, and double whip.

As you can guess, the number of drink combinations you can create is too
daunting for a programmer to represent one by one. And what if the cafe
adds a new base drink, or a new drink addition? The numbers just keep
growing! How can we design a system that lets you create any number
of drinks from existing options, and has room for new drinks options?

Lastly, each drink has a cost and a description, built from the sums
of a drink's component costs and descriptions. XX fill out more


Here is an example UML for a theoretical implementation:
XX make/get UML

[[file:lab1-1-design.png][Example Java UML]]

This sample design translates well enough from object-oriented to functional.
Note the "well enough." There are some drawbacks that we shall discuss soon...

We can use custom types to represent the different drink objects as well as a
structure for representing combinations of drink objects. Adding a new
core drink or drink addition is as simple as making a new instance
of the type. To get the cost or description of a complicated drink like
"Espresso with milk and double mocha and soy," we use a recursive function.

HOWEVER... Because the new drinks and drink additions are instances of
a type, and not their own types, we aren't able to distinguish between
different drinks/additions just by looking at their type. We have to
check their description. Relying on strings is never a good idea when
you have something as great as type safety, but sadly, in this approach
our hand is forced.

Here we have two implementations, one written in Haskell and the other
written in F#. The two languages have similar syntax, but the
implementations will have subtle differences.

#+BEGIN_SRC f#
-- Beverages.fsi
type BasicBeverage = {
    cost: float
    description: string
}

type BeverageAddition = {
    cost: float
    description: string
}

type CafeBeverage =
| BasicBeverage of BasicBeverage
| FancierBeverage of BeverageAddition * CafeBeverage

type Parser = String -> Either ParseError String
#+END_SRC

Note that while the BasicBeverage type and the BeverageAddition type
hold the same data, we keep them separated. If they were the same,
then someone could create a drink that was, say, pure soy, or milk
with whip. While there's probably some cafe out there that would
let you to order those things, for our purposes, any drink MUST have
a BasicBeverage at its root.

CafeBeverage is a recursive type, and this is what allows for
decorating. Imagine a tree that can't branch. A stick, if you will.
It can only extend in one direction until it terminates. You can
have a drink with as many BeverageAdditions as you want, but you
must include a BasicBeverage to make it complete.

Let's create a BasicBeverage and some BeverageAdditions. Because
BasicBeverage and BeverageAdditions are types, we can create as
many as we want.

#+BEGIN_SRC f#
-- Beverages.fsi
let houseblend = BasicBeverage {cost=10.0; description="House blend"}
let milk : BeverageAddition = {cost=20.0; description="milk"}
let mocha: BeverageAddition = {cost = 5.00; description="mocha"}
#+END_SRC

Now let's make some drinks! We want a house blend with milk, and
a house blend with milk and mocha. Instead of making a new drink,
we'll decorate(!) the houseblend/milk combo to include mocha.

#+BEGIN_SRC f#
-- Beverages.fsi
let houseblendWithMilk : CafeBeverage = FancierBeverage (milk, houseblend)
let houseblendWithMilkAndMocha: CafeBeverage = FancierBeverage (mocha, houseblendWithMilk)

#+END_SRC

Okay, great! But how do we calculate the costs? And get the description?

#+BEGIN_SRC f#
-- Beverages.fsi
let rec getCost (bev: CafeBeverage) =
    match bev with
    | BasicBeverage b -> b.cost
    | FancierBeverage (a,b) -> a.cost + getCost b

let rec getDescription (bev: CafeBeverage) =
    match bev with
    | BasicBeverage b -> b.description
    | FancierBeverage (a,b) -> a.description + " and " + getDescription b

getCost houseblendWithMilk
getDescription houseblendWithMilk

getCost houseblendWithMilkAndMocha
getDescription houseblendWithMilkAndMocha

#+END_SRC

How simple and nice. This way, cost and description calculations are
completely independent from any implementation of a drink.


In the end, this implementation is fair enough, but doesn't take advantage
of a strongly typed system. We have to peer inside instances of types
to differentiate drinks and drink additions. XX

One thing to note about the Decorator pattern and functional programming--
When decorating a function to give it additional functionality,
function composition is the way to go. In functional languages this is
extremely simple. You can take an old function, make a new function that
takes the old function's output and tweaks it as desired and returns
the new result, then compose the two together and get a single
function that takes the same input as the old function, but returns
the new result.
